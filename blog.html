			 "about":"Born in Dublin on 16 October 1854, Oscar Wilde was a flamboyant and sparklingly witty Anglo-Irish playwright, poet and critic. ‘I put all my genius into my life, I put only my talent into my books’, he said to the French writer André Gide.

Wilde shone at both Trinity College, Dublin and Magdalen College, Oxford. In London, he was a famous proponent of aestheticism, the controversial theory of art. A collection of poems (1881) was followed by The Happy Prince and Other Tales (1888) as well as lectures and essays promoting his ideas of art and beauty"}
